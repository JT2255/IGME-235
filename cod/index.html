        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <em>Call of Duty</em> is a first-person shooter set during World War II and the first title in a long-running series. 
            It is also the first game by development <br>studio Infinity Ward and in some ways builds upon <em>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</em>, 
            a similar title a part of the team had been working on <br>at <em>2015, Inc.</em> before forming a new company.
            <br><br>
            Players experience the battle in Europe during World War II in different campaigns divided further into missions. 
            Unlike <em>MoH: AA</em> these are not<br> only presented from the view of an American soldier, there is a British and a Soviet campaign as well,
            each focusing on different parts of the battle.<br> In total there are 24 interconnected missions to play to get to Berlin. In each 
            campaign a different perspective is offered, starting as an American <br>Paratrooper during D-Day, progressing to assume the role as 
            an English Special Forces commando, and finally as a Russian tank commander.<br> Some missions are played in solitary fashion, but in 
            most of them the player is part of a larger group with computer-controlled team mates.
            <br><br>
            Most of the combat is infantry-based, but some is also set between vehicles or tanks. Multiplayer modes include death match,<br> 
            team death match, behind enemy lines (where the allies are outnumbered) and two objective-based modes: retrieval, and search and destroy.

        <h2>Quote</h2>

        <blockquote>
            'It's hard to find fault with "Call of Duty." It has it all: harrowing missions, top-notch graphics and special effects, 
            and convincing audio <br>and voice acting. Few games in this genre approach the level of polish and design seen here. Playing 
            through the game as part of a team<br> is no gimmick -- instead, it turns a good game into a great one. Do yourself a favor. 
            Buy this game. Just don't forget to keep your head down.'<br>
