    <p>
        My name is Joe and I am a Game Design & Development major at RIT. I am interested in everything gaming from
        playing games to designing and programming them. I
        hope to get better at creating websites in the class and get a better understanding of CSS as I am not very good
        with it. I have enjoyed my time at RIT
        so far and I hope when I graduate I will be very good at designing and programming games. I want to be able to
        sit down and create games that I think of
        without having to deal with not knowing how.
