    <p>
        My name is Joe and I am a Game Design & Development major at RIT. I am interested in everything gaming from playing games to designing and programming them. I 
        hope to get better at creating websites in the class and get a better understanding of CSS as I am not very good with it. I have enjoyed my time at RIT
        so fare and I hope when I graduate I will be very good as designing and programming games. I want to be ableto sit down and create games that I think of
        without having to deal with not knowing how.
