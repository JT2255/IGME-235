        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Dig Dug</b> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to
            dig your way through the earth. <br> Stopping you from doing this are two monsters,
            called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. <br> The only weapon
            that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the
            point where they explode. [...]

        <blockquote>
            This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs,"
            or at least had a good imagination. <br> And maybe they were into horror movies too.
