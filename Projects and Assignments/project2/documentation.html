    <p id="docu">I started this project by deciding that I wanted to use the dog API becuase I like dogs a lot. I first started with 
        the starter code found on github. I then implemented new dropdowns to the choose the breed/subreed of the dog to see 
        and the amount of dogs to see as well. I then coded in JS to grab multiple dog images and display them in a grid with css. 
        Finally I added a random button for my 3rd control that will diplay a random assortment of dogs and a random number of images 
        as well up to 50. I meet the requirement for the design by changing the layout of the buttons and images output. There is also 
        a text output on the screen that shows the process of the image fetching, filling the requirement of telling the user what the 
        current state of the website is. I also put all of the controls inside its own flexbox, in order to allow it to scale down to 
        smaller widths easily. The grade I would give myself on this project is somewhere between a 75 and an 80. The reason for this 
        is that it showcases what we learned in class, but does not go above and beyond the class content.
