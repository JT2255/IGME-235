        The process for this project was a long one as I could not figure out what I wanted to do for a while. After 
        settling for a pixel art creator, <br>I got to work on thinking of what controls I could add for the website. Then 
        it was about figuring out the layout and design of the buttons. <br>I settled on something simple that wouldn't be 
        hard to understand while also being pleasing to the eye. For sound design, I went with a click <br> sound when selecting
        buttons that makes a users click feel impactful. I got the sound from <a href="https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/click/">here</a>.
        I met the requirement of having a class by <br> using a class for the grid of pixels. It holds all of the information of the grid including 
        the cells and their data. The website also looks good <br> on multiple ranges of displays because the controls use a flexbox layout
        that wraps when it hits the border of the page. Overall, I think the <br>   project came out nice and I like how it turned out.
