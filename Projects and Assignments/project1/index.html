        <article class="whaleShark"> Whale sharks are the largest species of shark currently alive in the world. They are found in all of the tropical
            oceans of the world. They feed on plankton and travel extremely long distances in order to find enough food and to reproduce.
            While the maximum size of the whale shark is not known, they have been seen as large as 20m. The main cause of whale shark
            endangerment is due to the fact that they are highly valued on the international meat market. They are extremely overfished in 
            order to harvest their meat and fins. Whale shark tourism also disrupts the population  as it can interrupt their feeding
            and sharks have a chance of being injured by boats and humans. Currently the WWF is studying whale shark habits and tagging whale 
            sharaks in order to set up greater protection measures for them. The WWF is also helping out with shark tourism by educating people 
            and companies on how to safely conduct tourism without affecting the sharks or their habitats.

        <article class="secondShark"> Great whites are the largest known predatory fish on the planet. They have over 300 teeth but don't 
            use them to chew their food. Instead, they rip their pray into small pieces and swallow them whole. They are an important part of 
            the ocean, sitting at the top of the marine life food chain. Great whites are decreasing in numbers due to being overfished and hunted 
            for their fins and teeth, often used as trophies for sport fishing. The great white is also often caught accidentally by commercial fisheries 
            and can get stuck in meshes used to protect numerous beaches. While not a lot is known about the behavior of the great white, WWF 
            is helping research and monitor them in order to keep them safe. Many sharks are tagged and tracked, allowing the WWF to set up a 
            behavioral management plan for the protected area where they are found, in order to protect them from accidental catches and to regulate
            tourism.

        <article class="thirdShark"> The shortfin mako shark is a fairly large sized shark compared to many others. It inhabits offshore temperate and tropical
            seas worldwide. The mako shark mainly eats cephalopods and many bony fish including tunas and swordfish, however they have been known to 
            eat other sharks, sea turtles, and seabirds. The shortfin mako shark also has one of the largest brain-to-body ratios, making them intelligent
            sharks. They have been shown to be quick-learning sharks, able to deduce whether many things are threats, including humans. Like great whites, 
            makos are also hunted by both sport and commercial fisheries. Their fins are also used frequently in shark fin soup, making them larger targets
            than other sharks. Due to this, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service included shortfin makos on their list of managed sharks, and reduced
            the allowance of commercial and recreational shortfin mako catches annually by 50. Although this only applies in the United State's Atlantic and 
            Gulf waters, it is a start to saving them from even lower population numbers.
